## Frog Tsunami

Implemented using HTML, CSS, Typescript and Canvas

FrogTsunami is a side-scrolling infinite game inspired by Zombie Tsunami

There are four power ups:

-   Shield protects the frogs from bomb and cars.
-   Jump Boost allows the frogs to jump higher.
-   Magnet attracts the coins toward frogs.
-   Speed increases the overall speed of game.

Insects increases the number of frogs

Colliding with bomb and cars kills the frog.
The cars move towards the frog.
